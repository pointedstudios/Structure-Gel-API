# MCGradle Scripts Changelog

## 0.5.3

- Ported the auto-updater for the bash scripts. PowerShell superiority is no more.
- Dropped support for using MCGradle Scripts as a Git submodule. It's too risky with the new auto-updater I made.

## 0.5.2

- Added an auto-updater for the PowerShell scripts. Support for the bash scripts coming soon!
- Fixed `genIntellijRuns.bat` crashing on launch.

## 0.5.1

- MCGradle Scripts is now licensed under GNU General Public License Version 2.
- Tweaked PowerShell title change at the end of the script.
  - Windows: The title will revert to what it was before the script ran.
  - macOS and Linux: The title will be set to null.
- The PowerShell script will now detect if you are running Windows PowerShell or PowerShell Core, and whether or not you are running it through Windows Command Prmopt.
- Simplified the greeting screen to take up less space.
- Refactored the scripts to be cli friendly.
- Added an option to do a full cleanup of the workspace.
  - This option will delete your build, eclipse, and .idea folders, along with any other cache files.
- Fixed Gradle deleting the PowerShell title after it finishes running a task.
- Fixed the bash version of MCGradle Scripts not accepting lower case values.
- The colors in the bash version of MCGradle Scripts now match that of the PowerShell version.
- Fixed genIntellijRuns for PowerShell not echoing a message to the console.
- The Windows Command Prompt wrapper for PowerShell will now return to the Windows directory after it finished (for the subscripts).
- General bug fixes and performance improvements (view commit history for more details).

## 0.5.0

- Cleaned up the scripts and made them easier to read.
- Introducing: MCGradle Scripts Hub!
  - Access all the Gradle commands from a single batch file!
  - Features easy-to-read menus.
  - Makes running the scripts 100x easier! Simply launch the main MCGradle Scripts script and get going!
- The scripts are no longer being written for Windows Command Prompt. Windows Command Prompt now simply acts as a wrapper for the PowerShell scripts.

## 0.4.1

- The Windows Command Prompt scripts no longer need admin privileges to get the mod name from `mods.toml`.
- Deleted unused scripts that are no longer needed.
- The Windows Command Prompt scripts now use PowerShell to check for updates.
- Fixed error message displaying a broken link to the issue tracker.

## 0.4.0

- This project is now named MCGradle Scripts. It was previously unnamed.
- MCGradle Scripts will now use the same version number for the Windows Command Prompt, PowerShell, and GNU bash scripts.
- MCGradle Scripts will now check for updates from the GitHub repository.
- If the update check fails, the scripts will continue as normal. This (in theory) allows MCGradle Scripts to be run offline.
- Rewrite some of the scripts to make them easier to read with consistent usage of casing and comments throughout each of the methods.
- MCGradle Scripts will clear the screen if one of the scripts are run. This gives it its own detatched feel from the normal shell the user would be running.
