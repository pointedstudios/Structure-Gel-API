All of these biome dictionary entries start with "structure_gel:" unless otherwise specified. Other mods are able to register their own entries, so it's up to them to document them. These are only the ones natively found in Structure Gel.

As of right now, this biome dictionary has built-in support for vanilla biomes, Biomes O' Plenty, Endergetic Expansion, and Nethercraft. As a result, some tags only apply if those mods are installed, such as structure_gel:nether_fleshy.

# Special
These biomes don't really fit the other groups, so I put them here.
- overworld : Any biome found in the Overworld. By default, this includes any biome from vanilla or Biomes O' Plenty as long as they are not in The Nether or The End.
