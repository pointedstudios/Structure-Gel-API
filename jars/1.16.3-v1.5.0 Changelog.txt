1.16.3-v1.5.0

Requires Forge 1.16.3-34.1.23 or newer.
A semi-major update that adjusts the internal behavior of GelTeleporter and gives more biome dictionary support.

Changes:
- Changed how GelTeleporter works internally to no longer require coremodding.
- BiomeDictionary
	- With forge re-implementing their biome dictionary, support for it has been added here.
		- Any forge entry can be accessed the same as the structure_gel ones, except they start with the "forge" namespace instead.
		- Check out this file for a full list of biome dictionary entries added both by structure gel and forge.
			- https://gitlab.com/modding-legacy/structure-gel-api/-/blob/1.16.3/biome_dictionary/1.16.3-v1.5.0.md
	- Added support for the following mods (Some may not be on 1.16.3 yet, so they just exist for the future)
		- Oh The Biome's You'll Go
		- The Aether (not on 1.16.3 yet)
		- Nethercraft (not on 1.16.3 yet)
		- Pagamos
		- Moolands
		- Rediscovered
		- Good Night's Sleep (this mod handles biomes on it's own, so this acts as a pointer for the good dream and nightmare dimensions)
		- Glacidus (not on 1.16.3 yet)
	- During FMLCommonSetupEvent, any biomes not registered to the structure gel biome dictionary will be automatically registered by making assumptions based on the biome's properties, like temperature, humidity, category, and its forge biome dictionary data. Overall, this should be fairly accurate, but may not be perfect in every case. As such, you can disable it completely or on a mod-specific basis through the structure gel config.

Fixes:
- The "/structure_gel biomedict" now sorts results in alphabetical order.
- Using the ON_SURFACE no longer locks up the world.
- Fixed configs not properly checking for whitelist mode with biomes.
- Fixed a vanilla bug where mob spawners were causing fps lag in some cases. This can be disabled in the config.
