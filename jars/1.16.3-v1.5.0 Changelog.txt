1.16.3-v1.5.0

Requires Forge 1.16.3-34.1.23 or newer.
A semi-major update that adjusts the internal behavior of GelTeleporter and gives more biome dictionary support.

Changes:
- Changed how GelTeleporter works internally to no longer require coremodding.
- BiomeDictionary
	- With forge re-implementing their biome dictionary, support for it has been added here.
		- Any forge entry can be accessed the same as the structure_gel ones, except they start with the "forge" namespace instead.
		- Check out this file for a full list of biome dictionary entries added both by structure gel and forge.
			- https://gitlab.com/modding-legacy/structure-gel-api/-/blob/1.16.3/biome_dictionary/1.16.3-v1.5.0.md
	- Added support for the following mods (Some may not be on 1.16.3 yet, so they just exist for the future)
		- Nethercraft (not on 1.16.3 yet)
		- Pagamos
		- Moolands
		- Rediscovered
		- Good Night's Sleep (this mod handles biomes on it's own, so this acts as a pointer for the good dream and nightmare dimensions)
		- Glacidus (not on 1.16.3 yet)
		- Oh The Biome's You'll Go

Fixes:
- The "/structure_gel biomedict" now sorts results in alphabetical order.
