1.16.3-v1.4.0

General additions and changes to work better with BiomeLoadingEvent.

Changes:
- Upadted minimum forge version to 1.16.3-34.0.13.
- Optimized code for finding existing portals
	- Only locates portal blocks with no portal below them since they're the only ones that will be considered for teleporting.
- Most methods in BiomeAccessHelper have been deprecated since BiomeLoadingEvent achieves their purpose in a better way.
- ConfigTemplates.StructureConfig now stores filtered biomes as ResourceLocations.
- Console logging for skipping the warning when loading an existing world was moved to info.
- You can now skip the warning for experimental settings when creating a new world via config.
- Deprecated the following events as they can now be done natively in forge. These will be removed in 1.17.
	- RenderCloudsEvent
	- RenderSkyEvent
	- RenderRainEvent

Additions:
- Portals can now be placed on the surface using GelTeleporter.
- Added new methods to BiomeAccessHelper that work with BiomeLoadingEvent.
	- addStructure(BiomeLoadingEvent, StructureFeature, StructureSeparationSettings, List<DimensionSettings>)
	- addStructure(BiomeLoadingEvent, StructureFeature)
	- addStructureIfAllowed(BiomeLoadingEvent, StructureFeature)
- BiomeDictionary
	- Added new methods to check if an entry contains the provided biome.
		- BiomeType.contains(ResourceLocation)
		- BiomeType.contains(RegistryKey<Biome>)
- GelPortalBlock
	- Added rendering methods for showing the portal overlay.
		- renderPortal(timeInPortal, scaledWidth, scaledHeight): Renders the portal overlay. Nether portal render by default.
		- getPortalTexture(): Gets the texture to render. This may be all you need to override for simple cases. Returns the texture for itself by default.
- RegistryHelper
	- Added registerExact as a variation of register.
		- Returns the exact type of the object passed in instead of the registry type.
		- This will replace register in 1.17 since it's more precise.

Fixes:
- GelTeleporter.ICreatePortalFuncion was private.
- Console logging when skipping an experimental world load screen was happening after the world loaded.
