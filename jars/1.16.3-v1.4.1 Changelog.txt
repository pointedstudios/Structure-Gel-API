Updated to Forge 34.1.19
Minor change to fix getKey and getValue with RegistryHelper as well as updating to use new forge features.

Changes:
- Mixins

- GelStructure 
	- Uses forge's new system for structure mob spawns.
- BiomeDictionary
	- Split structure_gel:mountains into structure_gel:mountains and structure_gel:snowy_mountains
	- Added Nethercraft support for when that's ready
	- Added more nether tags
		- nether_fungal: For biomes with a bunch of mushrooms, like crimson and warped forests
		- nether_sandy: For biomes with "sand", like the soulsand valley
		- nether_extreme: For biomes that have harsh landscapes, like the basalt delta
		- nether_fleshy: For biomes with a lot of flesh, like the visceral heap in Biomes O' Plenty

Additions:
