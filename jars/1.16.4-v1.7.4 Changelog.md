# 1.16.4-v1.7.4

Basically a bugfix update

## Changes
	- Structures may now generate in superflat worlds
	- Modified how StructureRegistrars work when registering
		- Now registers to FlatGenerationSettings
		- Uses a new registerStructure method when applicable (old method deprecated)
	- StructureRegistrars now optionally store separation settings inside of them
		- For existing code:
			- If a structure is a GelStructure, it will use the settings stored inside
			- If a structure is not a GelStructure, it will use a default value
		- For new code:
			- If a structure is a GelStructure, no changes needed from how it used to work
			- If it isn't a GelStructure, you'll need to define separation settings with the `withSeparation()` method
	- Updated loggers to be clearer as to where they come from

## Fixes
	- Fixed crashes with previous version where structures weren't getting added to FlatGenerationSettings
	- Fixed structures sometimes not having their seed set correctly
