1.16.2-v1.3.0

This is a major update seeing as 1.16.2 massively changed worldgen. Along with porting the mod forward, the functionality of the API has been extended to assist with dimensions and the biome dictionary.
All package declarations start with com.legacy.structure_gel.

Additions:
- Added the @Internal annotation
	- Applied to any field that's used internally by the API, meaning you shouldn't need to touch it. 
	- Makes the code easier to navigate and understand.
- Biome Dictionary:
	- Since Forge removed the biome dictionary in 1.16.2 for the time being, a replacement exists here. 
	- Functions as a ForgeRegistry, so you can add to it with the normal registry events.
	- To add support for your mod, check the biome_dictionary.BiomeDictionary class to see what you need to do. You don't need to have the API as a dependency, you only need to add a method to your main mod class.
	- Contains built in support for various mods.
		- Endergetic Expansion
		- Biomes O' Plenty
		- Good Night's Sleep
- Commands:
	- All commands are now under /structure_gel.
	- biomedict:
		- gettypes: Returns the biome dictionary types of the biome you're standing in.
		- gettypes <biome>: Returns the biome dictionary types of the biome.
		- getbiomes <dictionaryentry>: Returns the biomes associated with the dictionary entry.
	- savestructures <from> <to>: Runs the save function on all structure blocks in save mode in the area.
		- Duplicates are printed to the chat for you to teleport to.
- Config:
	- Client:
		- gui.skip_experimental_backup_screen: Skips the screen that warns you a world uses experimental settings.
- RegistryHelper:
	- Has new getKey and getValue methods for dealing with the new RegistryKey stuff.
	- Added methods for registering points of interest since the required methods are normally hidden.
- access_helpers.BiomeAccessHelper:
	- Contains methods for adding features, structures, carvers, flower features, mob spawns, spawn costs.
	- Contains methods for getting/setting the surface builder and ambiance.
	- New methods for adding instances of GelStructure to a biome.
- access_helpers.DimensionAccessHelper:
	- Contains methods for creating a DimensionSettings instance.
- util.DimensionTypeBuilder:
	- A builder to construct your own DimensionType.
	- Values default to overworld settings if not set.
- util.ConfigTemplates$StructureConfig:
	- Added a config field for what noise settings a structure is allowed to generate in.
		- Defaults to include all vanilla DimensionSettings.
- Registrars:
	- Handles storing and registering data for objects with complex registries.
	- Register data with the handle() method.
	- registrars.StructureRegistrar:
		- Contains a structure, structure piece type, and structure feature.
	- registrars.DimensionRegistrar: 
		- Contains registry keys for a dimension, dimension type, and dimension settings.
- Events:
	- events.RegisterDimensionEvent:
		- Fired when starting the server to register dimensions. You don't need to do it in the data folder if you do it here, and it handles updating dimensions nicely.
		- Use alongside registrar.DimensionRegistrar.
	- events.RenderSkyEvent:
		- Fired when rendering the sky to allow for a custom sky renderer.
	- events.RenderCoudsEvent:
		- Fired when rendering clouds.
	- events.RenderRainEvent:
		- Fired when rendering rain and snow.
	- events.RenderRainParticlesEvent:
		- Fired when rendering the rain particles on the ground.
- Portals:
	- Extending from the blocks.GelPortalBlock will allow you to easily create portals for your mod.
	- Call GelPortalBlock.fillPortal to attempt to fill the portal at the provided position whenever you want.
	

Changes:
- Various methods had to be changed thanks to the 1.16.2.
- Many classes were moved around or renamed. Here are some notable ones.
	- util.Collectors was renamed to util.GelCollectors.
	- The structures package was completely reorganized under worldgen.
	- structures.GelStructurePiece was renamed to worldgen.jigsaw.AbstractGelStructurePiece.
		- worldgen.jigsaw.GelStructurePiece is now used as the default instance of the abstract version.
- Jigsaw structures are now handled under worldgen.jigsaw.GelJigsawStructure.
	- Has handling data markers under worldgen.jigsaw.GelJigsawStructure#getPieceType.
		- Return an extension of worldgen.jigsaw.AbstractGelStructurePiece.
	- Handles custom placement options under worldgen.jigsaw.GelJigsawStructure#handleStartFactory.
		- You could create your own StructureStart, but this is a nice way to handle simple things.
- Using Mixins instead of ASM now.
	- Fixes a compatibility issue with Repurposed Structures.
- Biome related methods were moved out of util.RegistryHelper and put in access_helpers.BiomeAccessHelper.

Removed:
- Json structures have been removed. 
	- The current worldgen changes make reintroducing them tricky to say the least. They may be reintroduced at some point, but no promises.

Fixes: 
- Fixed an incompatibility issue with Repurposed Structures.
